### Building with Maven

You need [this profile](https://github.com/novoda/public-mvn-repo/blob/master/poms/settings.xml) in your ~/.m2/settings.xml.

The following command will setup the project and copy the necessary dependencies so that you can work in Eclipse.

    $mvn clean initialize -Peclipse
  
You can also do something like `mvn install`, which will build, install and run the tests (you'll need to attach an Android device for that).

### Eclipse project setup

Create an Android project from the 'app' directory and a plain Java project from 'api' directory. Add the API project to the app project build path and set it as exported.

There are two Android library projects that need to be included and specified in the Android project properties.

* [ActionBarSherlock](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock)
* [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator)
  
Clone these from the GitHub repos above, import them to your Eclipse workspace and point the app project to them in Properties > Android. Make sure that the Android support library is only included in one of these projects and the others depend on it.

### Can I skip all this Maven stuff?

Yes. However, you will need to look at the dependencies in the POMs and go hunting for the jars yourself.
