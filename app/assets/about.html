MusicBrainz is an open music encyclopedia that collects music metadata and makes it available to the public.

<br />
This application provides easy access to that data on your Android device. You can scan a barcode to look up release information or search for artists and releases. Registered users can submit tags, ratings and unknown barcodes.

Please note that this application is a work in progress. It began as a Google Summer of Code project in 2010 and is now developed in my spare time. Bug reports and comments are welcomed. Just select 'Feedback' from the menu.
