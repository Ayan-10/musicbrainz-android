The project requires the PayPal Mobile Payments Library which can be downloaded from:

https://www.x.com/community/ppx/xspaces/mobile/mep

The project also uses a remote exception logger which can be downloaded from:

http://code.google.com/p/android-remote-stacktrace

In Eclipse, create a directory called 'libs' within the project. Add the PayPal_MPL.jar to this directory. Right click the project and select 'Build Path' > 'Configure Build Path...' then 'Add JARs...' from the libraries tab and navigate to the directory you just created.
